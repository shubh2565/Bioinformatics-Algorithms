# Bioinformatics-Algorithms

Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret the biological data.

This repository focus on devolping core bioinformatics algorithms which are used to answer the questions related to biological/genomic data. The algorithms implemented here are taken from the book: [Bioinformatics Algorithms: An Active Learning Approach](https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/) by Pavel A. Pevzner and Phillip Compeau.

The algorithms are implemented in the Python programing language.
